Notes:
 - This analysis requires per-trade 'price_path' and/or 'target_prices' for precise time-to-target and alternative-exit simulation.
 - If profit_targets_hit_history is not provided, the function attempts a best-effort reconstruction from trade_log but detailed flags (time_degraded, resistance) may be unavailable.
